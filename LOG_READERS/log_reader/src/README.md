# Python Log File Exercise

 Problem 1 — Log Error Counter (Foundational DevOps Skill)
Scenario

You’re on call. A service is “acting weird.” You’ve been given a log file and asked a very basic question first:

    “How many errors are we seeing?”

This is often the first script juniors are expected to write.

## Task

Write a Python script that:

- Reads a log file named `app.log`
- Counts how many lines contain the word `ERROR`
- Prints the total count

That’s it. Keep it simple and readable.

## Constraints

- Use basic Python only
- No regular expressions
- No external libraries
- Assume the file exists and is in the same directory as the script

         Total ERROR lines: 3


## What I’ll Check When You Reply

- Correct file handling

- Clean loop logic

- No overengineering

- DevOps-style readability
