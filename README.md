# Better Dev Scripting 🛠️🐍

**Better Dev Scripting** is a hands-on practice repository focused on improving **Python scripting skills for DevOps and automation work**.

This repo is intentionally practical. Every script targets a real-world operational problem—things you actually automate on the job: logs, configs, services, files, and system output.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Build **strong fundamentals in Python scripting**
- Practice **automation-style thinking**, not algorithm puzzles
- Develop repeatable solutions to common DevOps problems
- Create a visible record of growth and consistency

All exercises are designed to be solvable in **1–2 hours** and revisited multiple times with variations.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

This repo follows a few core principles:

- **Small scripts > big projects**
- **Repetition over novelty**
- **Readability over cleverness**
- **Real-world constraints over abstractions**

Most scripts start simple and are later extended with additional constraints (e.g. no regex, limited libraries, stricter input handling).

## 🤖 AI-Generated Practice Problems

All practice problems in this repository are **generated with the help of AI** and then implemented, reviewed, and refined by the author.

AI is used as a **problem generator and scenario simulator**, similar to how a senior engineer might assign exercises or operational tasks.  
All code, structure, and improvements are written manually as part of the learning process.

This approach allows for:
- Rapid exposure to realistic DevOps scenarios
- Consistent difficulty scaling
- Focus on execution and reasoning rather than problem invention
